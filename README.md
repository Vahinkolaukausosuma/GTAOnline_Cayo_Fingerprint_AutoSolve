# GTAOnline_Cayo_Fingerprint_AutoSolve
Automatically solves the "hacking" fingerprint solving minigame

You need to have your game in fullscreen 1080p 16:9 (not sure if ratio matters)
or 1080p windowed borderless if your monitor is in 1080p as well.


When you start the script, the "debug window" is moved to -1280,465
Edit the WindowPositionX and WindowPositionY position variables to move the window. 0,0 point should be top left of your main monitor.
